How to disable the auto update *.ts(and other files) without pressing Ctrl + S
How to disable 'safe write' when WebStorm save changes to temporary file first and if saving was successful - then remove original file and rename temporary file.

    Settings / Appearance & Behavior / System Settings / Save file on frame deactivation: unchecked
    Settings / Appearance & Behavior / System Settings / Save files automatically if...: unchecked
    Settings / Editor / General / Editor tabs / Mark modified tabs with asterisk : checked

The resulting behavior is:

    Changes are not automatically saved in the file
    If you close a changed file, no warning is displayed
    If you close a changed file then reopen it, changes have not been lost
